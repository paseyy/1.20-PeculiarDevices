# 1.20-PeculiarDevices

Peculiar Devices is a tech mod for Minecraft 1.20.1. Heavily tiered, the mod allows you to discover, build and use obscure machines, powered by heat, water, light and more. 

## About
The mod has been designed following a few core principles:
- Fun: The mod should be first and foremost fun to play. This means no heavy grinding or AFK farming.
- Simplicity: Everybody hates cluttered UIs, so I am trying to keep it as clean and easy to understand as possible.
- Seamlessness: Everything should work right out of the box, even with other mods. If you find an issue please contact me.


## Development
The mod is currently a <b>work in progress</b>, and I am not actively developing it. I hope that I will find time soon to continue working on it, since I have some great ideas how to improve the mod. 

Please feel free to open a GitHub issue to report bugs etc., or contact me by mail: freibja \[at\] gmail \[dot\] com.
